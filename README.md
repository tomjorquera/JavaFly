JavaFly
=======

This is a java implementation of my Firefly agent model. The goal of is to propose a simple agent model for general distributed problem solving. In order to instantiate the model, the designer must provide several domain-specific functions to model the problem to solve and create the agents. The agents will then try to solve the problem using a simple solving decision engine.

More details are given in the javadoc and in the example inside the project.
